            <span>welp, this is a sorter place of sorts for my website adventures that can hardly be called websites and are probably abandoned halfway through development.</span>
            <span>enjoy.</span>
            <span>isn't neobrutalism fun?</span>

            hello, this is flora! this is a quick silly bio for this quick silly centralised landing page.<br><br>
            i figured why use the one free github website address for just one project when you can... <span>use it for all of them?</span><br><br>

        <a href="pr/pr_index.html"><span>one mediocre portfolio landing page to rule them all</span></a>
        <a><span>another project with a weirdly long title</span></a>
        <a><span>a different project with not the same description</span></a>
        <a><span>something else that might peek your curiousity</span></a>
        <a><span>this should fit plenty stupid little projects for a lifetime</span></a>
        <a><span>and by that i literally mean six ok</span></a>
